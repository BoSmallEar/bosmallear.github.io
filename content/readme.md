**Hi, my name is Zhizheng Liu (刘知正)**. I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCLA. Before that, I earned my bachelor’s degree from the SJTU-UM Joint Institute and my master’s degree from ETH Zurich.

Throughout my research journey, I have been fortunate to receive invaluable guidance and support, without which I would not be who I am today. I am especially grateful to [Dr. Yikang Li](https://liyikang.top/), who first introduced me to research, and to my advisor [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/), whose continuous mentorship has been instrumental in shaping my academic path.

I aim to address fundamental research problems with real-world impact. My current focus is on **building world simulators for physical AI using accessible real-world data**. To this end, my work involves reconstructing real-world environments from casual videos ([JOSH](https://genforce.github.io/JOSH/)), learning from these reconstructions ([PedGen](https://genforce.github.io/PedGen/)), and transferring the knowledge to simulation ([Vid2Sim](https://metadriverse.github.io/vid2sim/)). I practice [slow science](http://slow-science.org/). 

Compared to listing my publications, I prefer to share the lessons I’ve learned through doing research—especially from failures—in the hope that they can be helpful and inspiring both to myself and to others.
