**Hi, my name is Zhizheng Liu (刘知正)**. I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCLA. Before that, I earned my bachelor’s degree from the SJTU-UM Joint Institute and my master’s degree from ETH Zurich.

Throughout my research journey, I have been fortunate to receive invaluable guidance and support, without which I would not be who I am today. I am especially grateful to [Dr. Yikang Li](https://liyikang.top/), who first introduced me to research, and to my advisor [Prof. Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/), whose continuous mentorship has been instrumental in shaping my academic path.

I aim to address fundamental research problems with real-world impact. My current focus is on **building world simulators for physical AI using accessible real-world data**. To this end, my work involves [reconstructing real-world environments](https://genforce.github.io/JOSH/), [learning from these reconstructions](https://genforce.github.io/PedGen/), and [transferring the knowledge to simulation](https://metadriverse.github.io/vid2sim/). I practice [slow science](http://slow-science.org/). Feel free to check my google scholar profile for a list of publications.

In my free time, I enjoy running, reading, and gaming.
