I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCLA. Before that, I earned my bachelor’s degree from the SJTU-UM Joint Institute and my master’s degree from ETH Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my research journey, I have been fortunate to receive invaluable guidance and support, without which I would not be who I am today. I am especially grateful to &lt;a href="https://liyikang.top/"&gt;Dr. Yikang Li&lt;/a&gt;, who first introduced me to research, and to my advisor &lt;a href="https://boleizhou.github.io/"&gt;Prof. Bolei Zhou&lt;/a&gt;, whose continuous mentorship has been instrumental in shaping my academic path.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
